          <h3>AIR KISS</h3>


<div>


    <input type="checkbox" class="read-more-state" id="post-2" />
    <p>Air Kiss is a film looking at a near future where governance has largely been outsourced to artificial intelligence. As a backdrop to the film comes an urban design project speculating on the unfolding of a decentralized AI-governance system.</p>
    <p>The social, political, cultural and spatial repercussions of these developments are vast. What does it mean and feel like to live in a world where computers have become the surrounding matter itself? When algorithms predict, suggest, decide, analyze and manage everything from basic income to infrastructures and your inner landscapes, what are the extents of your personal responsibilities? </p>

    <div class="read-more-wrap">
      <p class="read-more-target">Envisioned here is a system that attempts to be an universally fair real-time democracy. Users of this system —the citizens— are subjects to a continuous poll on their preferences about their living environments. Both by deliberate virtual voting and through the system tracking their behaviour, users influence the algorithmic system in designing and managing the city and geographies beyond it. Eye movements, skin temperature, heart rate, muscular tension, nutrition intake, blood consistency, geolocation, writing, speech, and silent speech, online behaviour, DNA, energy use:: all are monitored to draw complex maps in time and space —maps for algorithms to know, predict, suggest and decide.</p>
      <p class="read-more-target">Law is local and varies based on users' input. What used to be a room in a house, a street in the city, a neighborhood, or a nation are now all subject to different degrees of amorphous legislation and flavors of logic. This is an ecosystem that simultaneously dissolves old state, sovereignty, property and even personal boundaries. On the other hand it creates multiple levels of autonomy, zones that expand from anything like body parts to tectonic plates.</p>
      <p class="read-more-target">Privacy is dismantled, but data is not proprietary. It has lost its market value when a non-hierarchical system fed with fairness enforcing data is organizing society, production and basic income. But this system is not Big Brother, rather it is a twin sister - one with a million heads. Its AI are not servants, nor tools of control.</p>
      <p class="read-more-target">As true as it is a liquid anarchy, no centralized state or corporation claims ownership or responsibility to the decisions or processes of this system. Everything here is built on decentralized networks, everything is collective. The automation of matter has led to a total connectivity where functions dissolve into matter itself —known and arranged by the governance system down to the smallest particles. Organic and non-organic are consolidated. Still, the different rationalities and irrationalities of both nourish confusion, alienation and a bright visible spectrum of existentialism.</p>
      <p class="read-more-target">Technology —and its inevitability— creates worlds that taste bitter and sweet (aspartame). Worlds both horrible and beautiful at the same time.</p>

<p>"For the film, Air Kiss, the AI is a sentient ocean in which we walk and which feeds our thoughts (referencing the sentient surface of the planet Solaris in Tarkovsky’s film). It is in matter, it is based in continuous state computation (which we may call “chemistry”)</p>
<p>It is also a governing system. It senses, decides and reacts. It not only has a politics; it is politics. It invites both fascination and hatred, narcissisms both of acquiescence and refusal. As you’ll see, the AI in this film invites both Eros and Thanatos in equal measure.</p>
<p>The film is not only about machine vision it is for machine vision. As a film —as an object that happens to be a film and about which its AI may know things— Air Kiss anticipates a near future in which the whole archive of human-generated cinema is seen, modeled, and interpreted by algorithmic intelligences. Like its characters, it is an uneasily willing and unwilling participant in its own involvement; it is a film that knows it is destined to be training data for AI viewer it can only anticipate with a bit of trembling."</p>
